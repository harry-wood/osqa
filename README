This is OSQA project - open source Q&A system

This used to have a website with code, bug tracking, wiki, and (of course) Q&A.

Sadly osqa.net is lost to domain squatters now, you can see an archive.org copy here:

OSQA is based on the CNPROG project, originally created by Mike Chen and Sailing Cai.
